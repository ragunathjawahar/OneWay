Gradle [![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/ragunathjawahar/red-green-io/oneway/images/download.svg)](https://bintray.com/ragunathjawahar/red-green-io/oneway/_latestVersion)
---------------------
One Way is available on JCenter. If your project does not include `jcenter()` already, add it to your project's build script.

    allprojects {
      repositories {
        jcenter()
      }
    }

Then, include the dependencies in your module's build script.

    dependencies {
      implementation 'io.redgreen.oneway:core:(latest-version)'
      implementation 'io.redgreen.oneway:core-android:(latest-version)@aar'

      // Needed only if you want to use custom ViewGroup classes
      implementation 'io.redgreen.oneway:annotations:(latest-version)' 
      kapt 'io.redgreen.oneway:compiler:(latest-version)'

      // Recommended
      testImplementation 'io.redgreen.oneway:core-test:(latest-version)'
    }
